Problem Statement:
Building a news classification system involves several steps, including web scraping, data
preprocessing, and model training. Below is a high-level outline of the steps you can follow
using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques:

1. Web Scraping:
- Choose news websites (e.g., BBC, The Hindu, Times Now, CNN) and use web scraping
tools or libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup,Selenium) to extract news articles.
- Retrieve the title and content of each news article. Ensure that you have a diverse dataset
covering various topics.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Remove any irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, advertisements, or non-text content.
- Tokenize the text (split it into words or subwords) and remove stop words.
- Perform lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to their base form.
- Handle missing data and ensure a consistent format.
3. Text Representation:
- Convert the text data into numerical format suitable for machine learning models. This can
be done using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word
embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
- Consider using pre-trained word embeddings for better performance.
4. Topic Clustering:
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) on the preprocessed text
data to group similar articles together.
- Choose the number of clusters based on the topics you want to identify (e.g., Sports,
Business, Politics, Weather).
5. Topic Labeling:
- Manually inspect a sample of articles in each cluster to assign topic labels. This step helps in
labeling the clusters with meaningful topics.
6. Classification Model:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a supervised machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or
deep learning models like LSTM or BERT) to predict the topic of a news article.
- Use the labeled clusters as ground truth labels for training the model.

7. Evaluation:
- Evaluate the performance of your classification model on the testing set using appropriate
metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Fine-tune the model parameters if needed to improve performance.
8. Deployment:
- Deploy a classification application using streamlit application
